This example demonstrates the step-by-step process of constructing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the presence of viral pneumonia in computer tomography (CT) scans. While 2D CNNs are typically used to process RGB images with three channels, a 3D CNN is an extension that processes volumetric data. By taking input as a 3D volume or a sequence of 2D frames (such as slices in a CT scan), 3D CNNs offer a powerful model for learning detailed representations from volumetric data. This approach is particularly effective in medical imaging, where understanding the spatial relationships within the volume can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy.


To achieve this, we follow a series of steps including data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, and evaluation. The CT scan data is first preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality. The 3D CNN architecture is then designed to capture the intricate patterns within the CT scan volumes. Training the model involves feeding the preprocessed data into the network, allowing it to learn from the variations within the dataset. Finally, the model is evaluated using a test set to determine its accuracy and reliability in diagnosing viral pneumonia. The entire codebase, along with detailed explanations and visualizations, is provided to facilitate understanding and replication of the results.
